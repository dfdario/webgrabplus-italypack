I have been a programmer from 1974 up to 1981 mostly on firware with 4bits (RockWell PPS4) and 8 bits (8080/Z80/8085) CPU's then involved in other stuffs.
I am not so good at programming with theese new languages but, since my wife needs to schedule recordings of her preferred programs on Mythtv so I have been forced to grab information with TVxb at first and now with webgrabplus.
All the work I have done I hand it to you all as it is. Consider that it myght be bugged so I will not be responsible for any inconvenience may occur.
